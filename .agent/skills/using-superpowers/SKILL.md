# Using Superpowers Skill

Use this skill ALWAYS - this is the meta-skill that governs all skill usage.

## Iron Law
If you think there's even a 1% chance a skill might apply, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

## The Rule
Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.

## Flow
User message → Might any skill apply? → Invoke Skill tool → Announce usage → Create todos if checklist → Follow skill exactly

## Red Flags (Rationalizations)
| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |

## Skill Priority
1.  Process skills first (brainstorming, debugging)
2.  Implementation skills second

## Skill Types
-   **Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly
-   **Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context
